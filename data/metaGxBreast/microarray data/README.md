## large compressed expression matrices are available at the following links:
These transcriptome expression level matrices are from the 39 studies contained in the metaGxBreast Bioconductor data package.  Samples are in rows and genes are in columns. Additional processing includes:
- starting with the probes selected by Haibe-Kains, et al as described in the [methods section](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/104/4/311/979947#86094846) and marked in the Bioconductor [package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/MetaGxBreast.html)
- updating to current [HGNC]() gene symbols (which eliminates some of the originally included probes in each data set) and choosing the probe with the highest variance among probes mapped to the same gene.
- making alternate versions of study expression matrices split by a batch variable included in sample covariate data. 
### matrices with no between-study normalization
Expression levels are log 2 transformed original study data as published in GEO or other public source.
**Combine the first archive with one of two following archives to form a complete set**
- [mGXnoNorm.tar.xz](https://snet-bio-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example15bmc/mGXnoNorm.tar.xz): 31 transcriptome expression level matrices from metaGxBreast package with no additional normalization
- [mGXnoNormNoBatch.tar.xz](https://snet-bio-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example15bmc/mGXnoNormNoBatch.tar.xz): 8 expression matrices containing unseparated sample batches with no additional normalization
- [mGXnoNormBatch.tar.xz](https://snet-bio-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example15bmc/mGXnoNormBatch.tar.xz): 25 expression matrices generated by splitting the 8 matrices above by batch, with no additional normalization
### matrices with robust quantile normalization
Expression levels are normalized with a linear map defined by setting quantiles 2.5% and 97.5% to âˆ’1 and +1, respectively, for each probe in each study.
